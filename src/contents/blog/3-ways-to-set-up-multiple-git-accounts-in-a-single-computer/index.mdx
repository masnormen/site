Developers around the world is probably already familiar with Git and the most popular Git platform, GitHub. As a developer, I have my own personal GitHub account. But oftentimes, my workplace requires me to have a work-dedicated account.

On my laptop, I set up my work account first, and everything works flawlessly. When I want to switch my work account to my personal account, Git seems to only support having one account in one machine.

You have to add and remove the GitHub SSH keys for each account manually when you want to switch. I searched for solutions on the internet. But from what I read, it seems that sometimes those solutions work and sometimes they don't.

I tried using GitHub Desktop (yeah, I'm that desperate) but it doesn't support this feature yet. Even the GitHub team seems to intentionally leave this issue unsolved. Why though!?

In the end, I found 3 ways to use multiple Git account in one computer. First, you need to configure your accounts.

# Before you start

## Add your first GitHub Account

In this example, I'll add my work account first, then I'll add my personal Git account. You can follow the guide here:

> https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

I created the SSH key for my work account using ed25519 algorithm, like this:

```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "work@gmail.com"
```

This will create `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub` files in your `~/.ssh` directory by default.

And then, copy and add the contents of the public key onto your GitHub account settings, explained by this docs:

> https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

## Add your other GitHub Account

For this other account, you roughly need to follow the steps same as above. You should name the generated file with a different name from the first account, though.

I created the key for my personal account using other algorithm, RSA, like this:

```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "personal@gmail.com"
```

And then save them with other name. I chose `id_rsa_personal`. Don't forget to add the key into your GitHub account settings.

# Managing multiple credentials

So now I have two SSH keys in my computer and I have added them into GitHub:

- My work GitHub account key (`work@gmail.com`) located at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- My personal GitHub account key (`personal@gmail.com`) located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal`

Below these section is the many options you can choose on how to use your multiple GitHub accounts.

## Option 1: Switch account based on current working directory

For this option, you have to place all your work-related files in `~/Work` and you need to make sure you don't need to use your work account everywhere else. You'd want to access your project everywhere else using your personal account.

**Editing `.gitconfig`**

We need to create separate Git config files for each account. One for work account and one for personal account:

```ini title="~/.gitconfig.personal"
[user]
    name = personal-account
    email = personal@gmail.com
[core]
    sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal -F /dev/null
```

```ini title="~/.gitconfig.work"
[user]
    name = work-account
    email = work@gmail.com
[core]
    sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -F /dev/null
```

In your `~/.gitconfig`, add something like this:

```ini title="~/.gitconfig"
[includeIf "gitdir/i:~/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig.personal
[includeIf "gitdir/i:~/Work/"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig.work
```

Explanation:

- `.gitconfig.personal` and `.gitconfig.work` tells Git to use your configured name, email, and `sshCommand` to execute when authentication is required. This `sshCommand` adds the corresponding GitHub SSH key everytime we need authentication.
- The `.gitconfig` tells Git to use the config file `~/.gitconfig.personal` when your current working directory is on your home (`~/`) directory and its subfolders. It also tells Git to use the config file `~/.gitconfig.work` when your current working directory is on `~/Work`. `gitdir/i:` tells Git to read the directory name as case-insensitive.

**Usage**

Just `cd` into your work folder and your account will be switched accordingly when you use Git. See this example:

```sh
#- Cloning your work account's private repo on home will NOT work
#- As Git will use your personal account's key in this directory

(~/) $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/work-account/work-private-repo
Cloning into 'work-private-repo'...
ERROR: Repository not found.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
...

#- Cloning your work account's private repo on ~/Works WILL work
#- As Git will use your work account's key in this directory

(~/) $ cd ~/Works
(~/Works) $ git clone ssh://git@github.com/work-account/work-private-repo
Cloning into 'work-private-repo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 187, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (187/187), done.
...
```

Similarly, if you want to clone a private repo from your personal GitHub account, it will only work if you're on a directory outside of `~/Works`. Easy right?

**Pros**
- Probably this is the best option for you if you separate your work and personal project files

**Cons**
- Your account only works on your specified directory. Less "flexibility"
- Doesn't work well if your work and personal files are messy and scattered everywhere. But c'mon, just tidy it up!

## Option 2: Switch Git account based on custom host

Open the file `~/.ssh/config` and edit it to be like this:

```plaintext
Host github.com-personal
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
  HostName github.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  UseKeychain yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes

Host github.com-work
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  HostName github.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  UseKeychain yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes
```

Here, we can see the two identity files we created before, under two different hosts. Which means:
- When accessing `github.com-personal`, use the key `~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal`
- Otherwise, when accessing `github.com-work`, use the key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- Add the key to the SSH agent if it's not added yet
- After doing so, resolve the actual host `github.com`

Git will use different SSH files automatically when you use the corresponding host. You can also add a fallback using `Host *`. Let's say I want to use my personal GitHub account when the URL requested is neither `github.com-work` nor `github.com-personal`, just add this section:

```plaintext
#- SSH config for fallback (wildcard host)
Host *
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
  HostName github.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  UseKeychain yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes
```

**Usage**

When you want to use your personal account:

```sh title="Cloning using personal account"
$ git clone ssh://git@github.com-personal/personal-account/personal-private-repo
```

Similarly, if you want to use your work account, do this:

```sh title="Cloning using work account"
$ git clone ssh://git@github.com-work/work-account/work-private-repo
```

You will also need to update your origin URLs in your existing repos to use them with your preferred account, like this:

```sh title="Changing remote url"
#- Change the 'origin' remote's URL
$ git remote set-url origin ssh://git@github.com-personal/personal-account/personal-private-repo

#- Now it will automatically use your personal account when doing actions in the local repo
$ git remote -v
origin	ssh://git@github.com-personal/personal-account/personal-private-repo (fetch)
origin	ssh://git@github.com-personal/personal-account/personal-private-repo (push)
```

**Pros**
- Can be configured per-repository folder

**Cons**
- You'll have to change all of your repo's remote URLs to use one of the configured host
- Might accidentally use the wrong account if you forgot to change the host

## Option 3: Manually switch account using command line alias

Note that this option *will only work if* you have done the steps explained in **Option 2** above. If you're not a fan of the options above and just want a really, really simple way to switch account whenever you want it, you can make an alias in your shell to do this.

In your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` or whatever your shell's config file is, you can add these line:

```sh title=".zshrc"
alias use-personal-git="ssh-add -D && ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal &>/dev/null && ssh -T git@github.com-personal"

alias use-work-git="ssh-add -D && ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 &>/dev/null && ssh -T git@github.com-office"
```

Basically we remove all SSH keys and then add the corresponding GitHub SSH key that we want everytime we want to use that account. Then, we call `ssh -T` to make sure the account can be used.

**Usage**

I think it's self-explanatory already. If you want to use your personal account, you run this:

```sh title="Using personal account"
$ use-personal-git
All identities removed.
Hi personal-account! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Similarly, if you want to use your work account, do this:

```sh title="Using work account"
$ use-work-git
All identities removed.
Hi work-account! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

**Pros**

- Pretty straightforward
- You use the selected account only when you need it

**Cons**

- Since this also needs #2 to be configured, why not just use #2? Or even better, #1?

# Conclusion

So those are 3 ways you can choose to use multiple Git accounts in a single computer. I hope it can be helpful for newcomers or even experts who need to use two or more accounts in one machine.

I'm not really doing something new here. I actually compiled this article after reading a bunch of Stackoverflow questions and other people's blog posts.

Git is already >15 years old now. It's annoying that things as simple as account switching is not possible without "hacks". I hope 5 years from now this post will become obsolete 🙂
