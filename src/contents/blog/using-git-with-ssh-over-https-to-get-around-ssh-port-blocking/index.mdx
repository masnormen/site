Recently, thereâ€™s this one cafe in which I seemingly canâ€™t access Git every time I use their Wi-Fi. I canâ€™t push, pull, or fetch anything. Every git command which involves a remote server is either refused to connect or always timed out. I had to use my mobile data, which is annoying and not good for my wallet.

# The Culprit

It turned out that the ISP which the cafÃ© use (*Iâ€™m going to name and shame here: **Nâ€Œexa*** ðŸ¤¡) has blocked any kind of SSH access. I found out because I figured I can not SSH into my VPS instance as well.

I donâ€™t know why some ISP does this weird blocking of SSH port. This may also happen to you if youâ€™re using an internal company network. But fortunately, GitHub and some other Git providers have thought of this, and provided us with a way to connect with their server via SSH-over-HTTPS. If youâ€™ve heard of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), itâ€™s kind of a similar stuff, but with SSH instead!

# Using SSH-over-HTTPS

To check if SSH-over-HTTPS on GitHub is possible from your ISP, you can check using this command:

```sh
$ ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
> Hi [user]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Then, in your global `.gitconfig` file, insert this line or modify the existing config if it already exists:

```ini
[url "ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/"]
    insteadOf = https://github.com/

#- OR, depending on your usage or remote urls:

[url "ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/"]
    insteadOf = git@github.com:
```

> Tips: ðŸ¦Š GitLab also provide `ssh://git@altssh.gitlab.com:443/` for SSH-over-HTTPS.

This will basically replace all remote url fetch of `https://github.com/` and `git@github.com:` into `ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/`. So if you run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/masnormen/ziyo
```

It will automatically be turned into this URL:

```sh
$ git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/masnormen/ziyo
```

Note that whether this works or not depends on your ISP. If your ISP is smart enough, it may still detect that youâ€™re using the SSH protocol and block connection attempts. So good luck!
